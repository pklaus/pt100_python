pt100
=====

Python package with different calculation algorithms for Pt100 temperature sensors.

This package was written to facilitate converting Pt100 sensor resistance values to temperature values and back.
Different algorithms (e.g. lookup tables) and approximating polygonal functions are described in literature and in different sites on the Internet.
A further aim of this package is to make it easy to choose the right approximation or algorithm.
